- The user with the user_id of 1 will be the admin!!
- Click the little plus thingy in the bottom right corner of the page so you can see all the awesome stuff used in YEY:D
- I know it says php-site and not YEYD in some places. Thats because I called YEYD, php-site when I was developing it in room without knowing I would ever publish it :D
